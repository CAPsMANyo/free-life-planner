%% if you're still struggling with consent just imagine instead of
%% initiating sex you're making them a cup of tea you say hey would you
%% like a cup of tea and they go oh my god I would love a cup of tea
%% thank you then you know they want a cup of tea if you say hey would
%% you like a cup of tea and they're like uh you know I'm not really sure
%% then you can make them a cup of tea or not but be aware that they
%% might not drink it and if they don't drink it then and this is the
%% important bit don't make them drink it just because you made it
%% doesn't mean you're entitled to watch them drink it and if they say no
%% thank you then don't make them tea at all just don't make them tea
%% don't make them drink tea don't get annoyed at them for not wanting
%% tea they just don't want tea okay they might say yes please that's
%% kind of you and then when the tea arrives they actually don't want the
%% tea at all sure that's kind of annoying has you've gone to all the

%% in the time it takes to boil the kettle brew the tea and add the milk

%% them tea unconscious people don't want tea and they can't answer the
%% question do you want tea because they're unconscious okay maybe they
%% were conscious when you asked them if they wanted tea and they said
%% yes but in the time it took you to boil the kettle or brew the tea and
%% add the milk they are now unconscious you should just put the tea down
%% make sure the unconscious person is safe and this is the important
%% part again don't make them drink the tea they said yes then sure but
%% unconscious people don't want tea if someone said yes to tea started
%% drinking it and then passed out before they'd finished in don't keep
%% on pouring it down their throat take the tea away make sure they are
%% safe because unconscious people don't want tea trust me on this if
%% someone said yes to tea around your house last Saturday that doesn't
%% mean they want you to make them tea all the time they don't want you
%% to come around to their place unexpectedly and make them tea and force
%% them to drink it going but you wanted tea last week or to wake up to
%% find you pouring tea down their throat going but you wanted tea last
%% night if you can understand how completely ludicrous it is to force
%% people to have tea when they don't want tea and you are able to
%% understand when people don't want tea then how hard is it to
%% understand when it comes to sex whether it's tea or sex consent is
%% everything and on that note I'm going to
