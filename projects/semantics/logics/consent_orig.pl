%% 0:00 if you're still struggling with consent
%% 0:02 just imagine instead of initiating sex
%% 0:05 you're making them a cup of tea you say
%% 0:08 hey would you like a cup of tea and they
%% 0:10 go oh my god I would love a cup of tea
%%   0:12
%%   thank you then you know they want a cup
%%   0:15
%%   of tea if you say hey would you like a
%%   0:18
%%   cup of tea and they're like uh you know
%% 0:20
%% I'm not really sure then you can make
%%   0:23
%%   them a cup of tea or not but be aware
%%   0:26
%%   that they might not drink it and if they
%%   0:28
%%   don't drink it then and this is the
%% 0:30
%% important bit don't make them drink it
%%   0:33
%%   just because you made it doesn't mean
%% 0:35
%% you're entitled to watch them drink it
%%   0:37
%%   and if they say no thank you then don't
%% 0:41
%% make them tea at all just don't make
%%   0:43
%%   them tea don't make them drink tea don't
%%   0:46
%%   get annoyed at them for not wanting tea
%%   0:48
%%   they just don't want tea okay they might
%% 0:52
%% say yes please that's kind of you and
%%   0:54
%%   then when the tea arrives they actually
%%   0:57
%%   don't want the tea at all
%%   0:58
%%   sure that's kind of annoying has you've
%%   1:00
%%   gone to all the effort of making the tea
%%   1:02
%%   but they remain under no obligation to
%%   1:04
%%   drink the tea
%%   1:06
%%   they did want tea now they don't some
%% 1:09
%% people change their mind in the time it
%% 1:10
%% takes to boil the kettle brew the tea
%% 1:12
%% and add the milk and it's okay for
%%   1:14
%%   people to change their mind and you are
%%   1:16
%%   still not entitled to watch them drink
%%   1:18
%%   it and if they are unconscious don't
%% 1:21
%% make them tea unconscious people don't
%%   1:23
%%   want tea and they can't answer the
%% 1:25
%% question do you want tea because they're
%%   1:27
%%   unconscious okay maybe they were
%%   1:30
%%   conscious when you asked them if they
%%   1:32
%%   wanted tea and they said yes but in the
%%   1:34
%%   time it took you to boil the kettle or
%%   1:36
%%   brew the tea and add the milk they are
%%   1:37
%%   now unconscious you should just put the
%%   1:40
%%   tea down make sure the unconscious
%%   1:42
%%   person is safe and this is the important
%%   1:44
%%   part again don't make them drink the tea
%% 1:47
%% they said yes then sure but unconscious
%% 1:51
%% people don't want tea if someone said
%%   1:54
%%   yes to tea started drinking it and then
%%   1:57
%%   passed out before they'd finished in
%% 1:58
%% don't keep on pouring it down their
%%   2:00
%%   throat take the tea away make sure they
%%   2:03
%%   are safe because unconscious people
%%   2:05
%%   don't want tea trust me on this if
%% 2:08
%% someone said yes to tea around your
%% 2:10
%% house last Saturday that doesn't mean
%%   2:12
%%   they want you to make them tea all the
%%   2:13
%%   time they don't want you to come around
%% 2:15
%% to their place unexpectedly and make
%% 2:17
%% them tea and force them to drink it
%% 2:19
%% going but you wanted tea last week or to
%% 2:22
%% wake up to find you pouring tea down
%% 2:23
%% their throat going but you wanted tea
%% 2:25
%% last night if you can understand how
%% 2:27
%% completely ludicrous it is to force
%% 2:29
%% people to have tea when they don't want
%%   2:31
%%   tea and you are able to understand when
%%   2:33
%%   people don't want tea then how hard is
%% 2:35
%% it to understand when it comes to sex
%% 2:37
%% whether it's tea or sex consent is
%%   2:40
%%   everything and on that note I'm going to
%% 2:44
%% make myself a cup of tea
