(POLICY
 (currently runs afowl of these:

  (solution
   (3.a. Collects information relating to any person’s
    physical or mental health or condition, the provision of health
    care to a person, or payment for the same.)
   (this is the
    hardest one, simply do not save this information, and remove
    portions for it))

  (completed
   (3.b. Is a health-related skill and does not include
    a disclaimer in the skill description stating that the skill is
    not a substitute for professional advice.  Example: “This tool
    does not provide medical advice, and is for informational and
    educational purposes only, and is not a substitute for
    professional medical advice, treatment or diagnosis. Call your
    doctor to receive medical advice. If you think you may have a
    medical emergency, please dial your local emergency response
    phone number.”)
   (simply save this))

  (solution
   (3.c. Claims to provide life-saving assistance through the
    skill or in the skill name, invocation name or skill
    description.)
   (don't say such things in the description, see if the
    invocation name "life planner", must be changed, change
    to "personal planner" or something like <OTHERNAME>)
   )

  )

 (be sure to review everything in the final implementation)
 )
(SECURITY
 (need a valid signed cert)
 (verify requests were sent by Alexa)
 (ensure incoming requests are intended for your service)

 (probably need to use account linking, but don't have to do that
  this time around, can always submit for recert)
