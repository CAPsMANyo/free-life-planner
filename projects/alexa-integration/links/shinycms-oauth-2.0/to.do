(use boss to upgrade our fcms implementation, maybe even move it
 to internal, idk.  Maybe back it up.  Just don't get it in an
 nonworking state.  Make make
 /var/lib/myfrdcsa/codebases/minor/fcms/FCMS-2.0 or something, or
 make fcms/FCMS be a symlink to the current version, i.e. `ln -s
 fcms/fcms-versions/FCMS-2.0 fcms/FCMS`)

(upgrade shinycms to whatever is the appropriate version.  Figure
 out how to do it using the appropriate Perl installation
 manager, whatever we use, something called like use lib or lib
 Perl or something)
