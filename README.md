# free-life-planner
he Free Life Planner is the flagship application of the FRDCSA Project.  It provides Free Software Social Friendly AI for general use, but especially for those experiencing poverty, homelessness, disabilty and/or illness.  Note this is only the directory, most of logic is spread throughout FRDCSA.  Won't run without rest of FRDCSA.  It aims to help people get on top of every security (food, financial, health, emotional etc).  It achieves this by employing various planning techniques at multiple scales and granularities.  It closely tracks the user's condition and applies knowledge that has been gathered semi-automatically from online texts to their situation.
