## The FREE LIFE PLANNER (FLP)

What if one could collect thousands of A.I. tools and apply them towards planning their life? That’s exactly what FRDCSA has been working on for the last twenty years. Only now, you can download a VM containing the core systems. In today’s increasingly complex world, sometimes we can be blindsided by rules we didn’t know existed. If you’re living on the edge, this can be a disaster. What if all the rules that applied to us, from legal, to financial, to just basic common sense, were collected into a system that was capable of reasoning with them and planning with them. You could put your objectives into the system and it would factor in all these things and spit out a plan. Well that’s just one of the many things that FRDCSA’s Free Life Planner A.I. seeks to do.

A.I. is problem-solving, and software that can do this has to grow larger as problems and their complexity multiply. Over the last 20 years the FRDCSA project has collected thousands of codebases, and written hundreds of codebases, gluing everything together and making it available from within Emacs, Perl and Prolog. The Free Life Planner, FLP, takes this and applies it directly towards assisting users in their minute-to-minute, day-to-day, year-to-year lives.
Think of a massive collection like V’ger had in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, of things like strong game-playing systems like AlphaZero, but tailored to the specific problems people most often encounter with finances, meal-planning, transportation, health care, etc.

If you’re interested in a personal A.I. assistant, please continue reading about FLP. But it is after all only one of over 600 custom codebases developed for FRDCSA. Now, Panoply, the virtual machine distribution of FRDCSA, has been released for you to explore. So, let’s have a look at some of what the Free Life Planner can do for you.

Free Life Planner is a software program that helps people plan and manage their day to day lives.  It lies somewhere between a personal planner and home automation system, but is so much more...  It is the flagship application of the FRDCSA Project.  It provides Free Software Social Friendly AI for general use, but especially for those experiencing poverty, homelessness, disabilty and/or illness.  Note this is only the directory, most of logic is spread throughout FRDCSA.  Won't run without rest of FRDCSA.  It aims to help people get on top of every security (food, financial, health, emotional etc).  It achieves this by employing various planning techniques at multiple scales and granularities.  It closely tracks the user's condition and applies knowledge that has been gathered semi-automatically from online texts to their situation.

## Types of Problems

So, what kind of planning and management problems are we talking about?

Here are a few:

+ Remembering to take the trash out before the trash truck arrives.

+ Getting an automatic notification to stock up on groceries before a
predicted storm hits, including the list of the groceries you need.

+ Remembering that when you finish filling out some particular
paperwork, to send a copy to your doctor.

+ Remember what the doctors instructions were, in a paperless office
with Machine Comprehension software, and helping you to conform to them.

+ Reminding you to work on your taxes, and to change your air filter.

+ Telling you that a particular plan of yours violates various moral
and ethical constraints.

+ Generating a complex monthly financial plan with contingencies for
unexpected expenses and if certain income doesn't come through.


## Expected User Base

The use cases go on and on, it is, afterall, a *LIFE* planner, and
life is quite varied at times.


There are few user bases that are expected to benefit more strongly
from this system than others.

+ People with disabilities such as pervasive developmental disorders.

+ People in poverty who are one misstep from disaster.

+ People with unwieldy illnesses.

+ People who are homeless.

In fact, for each of these categories, there are special systems that
engage when the system knows they are applicable.
