## The FREE LIFE PLANNER (FLP)

Introducing the Free Life Planner (FLP) - a revolutionary artificial 
intelligence software designed to tackle global issues like poverty, 
hunger, and disease. Thanks to its open-source nature and the decreasing 
digital divide, FLP can be distributed worldwide at virtually no cost, 
providing superhuman problem-solving abilities to everyone. With FLP, 
we're paving the way for a virtual secondary social safety net, 
promoting self-reliance, improving quality of life, and saving lives. 
Join us in harnessing the power of free AI to create a better future 
for all.

## Overview

The Free Life Planner (FLP) is an innovative tool that harnesses the 
power of artificial intelligence to help you navigate the complexities 
of daily life. The FLP is your personal assistant, guiding you through 
life's unexpected challenges, and helping you achieve your goals with 
ease and confidence.

Powered by the FRDCSA project, the FLP combines a wealth of AI tools 
and resources to create a comprehensive, user-friendly system that 
takes the stress out of planning. Whether you're dealing with legal 
matters, financial planning, or simply trying to make sense of 
day-to-day tasks, the FLP is designed to simplify and streamline your 
life.

With a growing library of AI-powered tools, the FLP offers a versatile 
solution tailored to your unique needs. From meal planning and 
transportation to healthcare and home automation, our cutting-edge 
technology can help you stay on track and make informed decisions.

Designed with everyone in mind, the FLP is especially useful for 
those facing challenges or disadvantages. Our goal is to provide a 
system that fosters financial, emotional, and overall well-being, 
offering support and guidance at every turn.

While the FLP is still in development, our team is hard at work 
creating an installer that will make it easy to access and utilize 
the full capabilities of the system. In the meantime, you can explore 
the core components of the FRDCSA project by visiting our GitHub 
repository:

We believe that the Free Life Planner has the potential to 
revolutionize the way we approach life planning. By harnessing the 
power of artificial intelligence and providing a comprehensive, 
user-friendly system, we can help individuals navigate the 
complexities of daily life with ease and confidence. Stay tuned for 
updates as we continue to develop and refine this groundbreaking 
tool!

This page will soon be deprecated.  To see the new (under construction) 
pages for FLP (the Reference Manual in particular gives a thorough 
overview):

## Types of Problems

Here are some examples of planning and management problems:

+ Remembering to take the trash out before the trash truck arrives.

+ Getting an automatic notification to stock up on groceries before a
predicted storm hits, including the list of the groceries you need.

+ Remembering that when you finish filling out some particular
paperwork, to send a copy to your doctor.

+ Remember what the doctors instructions were, in a paperless office
with Machine Comprehension software, and helping you to conform to them.

+ Reminding you to work on your taxes, and to change your air filter.

+ Telling you that a particular plan of yours violates various moral
and ethical constraints.

+ Generating a complex monthly financial plan with contingencies for
unexpected expenses and if certain income doesn't come through.


## Expected User Base

There are few user bases that should benefit more from this system
than others:

+ People with disabilities such as pervasive developmental disorders.

+ People in poverty who are one misstep from disaster.

+ People with unwieldy illnesses.

+ People who are homeless.

+ People experiencing relationship violence.

+ Returning citizens.

There are special modules for each of these situations.

## A Few Screenshots

There is more work finished than we can display here, because we are
"dogfooding" FLP.  It has much personal info unfit to be demoed, so we
can only show a few screenshots at present.
