The FREE LIFE PLANNER (FLP).

What is it?

Free Life Planner is a software program that helps people plan and
manage their day to day lives.  (If you already function well enough
on your own and have no use for this software, please don't criticize
it because there are other people who desperately need such a system).

It lies somewhere between a personal planner and home automation
system, but is so much more...

So, what kind of planning and management problems are we talking about?

Here are a few:

+ Remembering to take the trash out before the trash truck arrives.

+ Getting an automatic notification to stock up on groceries before a
predicted storm hits, including the list of the groceries you need.

+ Remembering that when you finish filling out some particular
paperwork, to send a copy to your doctor.

+ Remember what the doctors instructions were, in a paperless office
with Machine Comprehension software.

+ Reminding you to record what meal you ate after the bathroom door is
opened.

+ Reminding you to work on your taxes, and to change your air filter.

+ Telling you that a particular plan of yours violates various moral
and ethical constraints.

+ Generating a complex monthly financial plan with contingencies for
unexpected expenses and if certain income doesn't come through.

At some future point in time I will collect more usecases and link to
them here:

https://frdcsa.org/~andrewdo/projects/flp/use-cases.txt

The use cases go on and on, it is, afterall, a *LIFE* planner, and
life is quite varied at times.


There are few user bases that are expected to benefit more strongly
from this system than others.

+ People with Disabilities such as Pervasive Developmental Disorders.

+ People in poverty who are one misstep from disaster.

+ People with unwieldy illnesses.

+ People who are homeless.

In fact, for each of these categories, there are special systems that
engage when the system knows they are applicable.

Here is a video of an older, much smaller and simpler version of the FLP
booting up (be careful, noisy):

Here is a paper on the SPSE2 subsystem, an early planning system for
FRDCSA which inspired parts of FLP.

Here is a video which shows some progress on the planner systems and also later the meal planner.

Older description:

# free-life-planner
The Free Life Planner is the flagship application of the FRDCSA Project.  It provides Free Software Social Friendly AI for general use, but especially for those experiencing poverty, homelessness, disabilty and/or illness.  Note this is only the directory, most of logic is spread throughout FRDCSA.  Won't run without rest of FRDCSA.  It aims to help people get on top of every security (food, financial, health, emotional etc).  It achieves this by employing various planning techniques at multiple scales and granularities.  It closely tracks the user's condition and applies knowledge that has been gathered semi-automatically from online texts to their situation.

Here are some links about it:
