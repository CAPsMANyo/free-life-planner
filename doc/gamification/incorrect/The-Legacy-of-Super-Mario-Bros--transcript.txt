hi everyone i'm tommy Thompson this is
0:03
AI in games today we're going to look at
0:05
a level design of super mario brothers
0:07
and how the core principles so why she
0:09
got on my immortal and Takashi Tezuka
0:11
have been revered and evolved in
0:13
subsequent games as we celebrate the
0:16
30th anniversary of super mario brothers
0:18
in 2015
0:20
today we're going to discuss not only
0:21
heard the Mario series continues to
0:23
reuse the same concepts are familiar but
0:25
adopts new ideas that fundamentally
0:27
never break the matter of formula this
0:30
video is in fact based on multiple
0:32
academic papers and the analysis of
0:34
level design a more fair and link to
0:36
them throughout should you wish to learn
0:37
more about this research
0:41
the Super Mario series started in
0:43
nineteen eighty-five with the release of
0:45
super mario brothers on the nintendo
0:47
entertainment system the game itself
0:49
introduce the number of innovations that
0:51
differentiated it from previous games
0:53
starring Mario such as the original
0:55
Donkey Kong and is largely inspired from
0:58
Mario Brothers an arena based game in
1:00
which both mario and luigi fight off
1:02
waves of enemies the game expanded on
1:05
mario brothers by introducing a range of
1:07
power-ups more flexible movement and
1:09
jumping mechanic scrolling to the rate
1:11
of the screen to discover the game world
1:13
and much more besides with over 290
1:17
million copies sold by 2015 the Super
1:21
Mario series is not only the most
1:22
successful series in video game history
1:24
but has established Mario and the core
1:27
mechanics of his games as a cultural
1:29
phenomenon but like any other videogame
1:32
property Mario continuing needs to
1:34
evolve there's a fundamental need for
1:36
video games to continue to energy on
1:38
their core concepts in order to maintain
1:39
interest from fans of course that's a
1:42
really difficult issue to tackle and /
1:44
nintendo receive a lot of hassle from
1:46
both the game press and indeed the more
1:48
vocal online communities about how they
1:50
feel to nav on the core manual formula
1:53
of course content will have deviated
1:56
from the original concept in many
1:57
respects having Maddie or prescribe
1:59
drugs develop a third dimension raid on
2:01
go-karts hold host parties turn into
2:03
paper and sort through galaxies babo
2:06
Super Mario Brothers other 2d games
2:09
simply derivative of throwing out the
2:12
same thing every couple of years and
2:14
different hardware the answer obviously
2:16
is no but how that's achieved is rather
2:20
fascinating
2:22
to understand how Superman your enemies
2:25
we need to concern yourself with the
2:26
idea of design patterns a constructive
2:29
game design which has a significant
2:31
impact on player experience the same
2:33
parents appear everywhere in video games
2:35
and we're good parents have phoned they
2:37
are often duplicated and other games and
2:39
indeed other genres a simple example is
2:42
that of coin collection and Mario
2:43
resulting an unlocking of valuable item
2:46
a pattern that's been subsequently
2:47
adopted for the likes of starting the
2:49
Hedgehog crash bandicoot and bind your
2:51
kazoo but in this case we want to look
2:54
at the patterns of Mardi level design
2:56
research in the same patterns and an
3:01
academic sense has actually been
3:02
conducted for some time now
3:04
however what we're looking at is a
3:06
particular body of one that was
3:07
conducted by Steve kalskag annually
3:09
imperious exploring the original Super
3:11
Mario Brothers acknowledging the game
3:13
aDOT's a group of roughly 20 patterns
3:16
that are repeated throughout each level
3:18
these patterns acknowledge the placement
3:20
of enemies the grouping of environmental
3:22
obstacles and even placement of coins
3:23
and power-ups and an effort to make
3:25
players commit the same small but
3:27
fundamental unique gameplay actions
3:29
through each level in addition each
3:32
Super Mario Brothers level when measured
3:34
in terms of individual game played beats
3:36
in which we cannot be as unique segment
3:38
of gameplay is roughly the same length
3:40
know what that doesn't mean they're the
3:42
same physical way but the number of
3:44
unique gameplay moments is roughly the
3:46
same this analysis did not address to
3:50
particular types of level underwater and
3:53
castles this is because on a fundamental
3:55
level the actually differently from the
3:57
rest of the game the way in which
3:59
players and tried with underwater levels
4:00
is totally different from the rest of
4:02
the game because well man is underwater
4:05
meanwhile castles are also different
4:07
because the introduction of bows are
4:08
sending fireballs through the map as
4:10
well as confronting him at the
4:11
drawbridge has an impact of how about
4:13
levels designed despite this there is
4:16
significant evidence that there is a
4:18
language they express his/her Super
4:20
Mario levels are designed so the key
4:22
question is does the same language apply
4:24
to future games in the series
4:28
in order to understand what impact this
4:31
design pattern language has we need to
4:33
look at each level in each game adheres
4:35
to the Super Mario Brothers formula
4:37
spans 10 different games across the last
4:41
30 years while there have been
4:43
significantly more than that were only
4:45
interested in games in the official
4:47
super mario series that routine the
4:49
original gameplay concepts so firstly we
4:52
can ignore all 3d Mario games
4:54
given that they are fundamentally
4:55
different from the 2d games
4:57
that's right go get it
5:01
furthermore three of the 2d super mario
5:04
games deviate from the original formula
5:06
to the point the games are actually
5:08
designed differently
5:09
Super Mario Land 3y land and super mario
5:12
world to yoshi's island are 2d Mario
5:15
games that don't play the original
5:16
likely because you don't plays mario
5:18
himself but also we need to assess the
5:21
real super mario brothers too
5:24
here's a bit of trivia for you the
5:26
american and european release of Super
5:28
Mario Brothers 2 is not actually super
5:30
mario bros 2 it's a reskin of Japanese
5:32
tight or unique or doki doki panick this
5:35
is all rather ironic given that docu
5:37
panic is a discarded prototype for super
5:39
mario brothers to the original Super
5:41
Mario Brothers 2 was released in japan
5:43
in 1986 but it did not make it to
5:45
western shores because nintendo of
5:47
america thought it would be too hard for
5:49
American audiences bunch of pansies it
5:52
was eventually released in america and
5:54
europe in 1993 when it was done Super
5:56
Mario Brothers the lost levels as part
5:59
of the super mario all-stars on the
6:01
Super Nintendo at the time of this video
6:04
this research has only looked at the
6:06
first world of each game while ignoring
6:08
the underwater and Castle levels despite
6:11
this this results in 42 different levels
6:14
being analyzed across 10 games that span
6:16
27 years of Mario history 2d Mario games
6:24
continue to use the same design pounds
6:26
from 30 years ago but there are some
6:28
really interesting observations when we
6:29
consider the number of unique beats of
6:31
game clean each level as well as the
6:33
actual patterns adopted
6:35
firstly Mario levels have progressively
6:37
increased the number of beats per level
6:39
and only recently began to reduce this
6:41
count actually the Mario Land games
6:44
carry the most beats per level of all
6:46
games which is an interesting idea
6:48
considering we would imagine levels for
6:50
a portable device would be less dense
6:53
with activity given modern habits of how
6:55
we consume mobile games
6:57
similarly the density of how many design
6:59
pounds are adopted for beat is only now
7:01
beginning to increase with some really
7:03
interesting applications and the new
7:05
super mario brothers series which we'll
7:06
talk about in a moment outside of bee
7:09
caves we observe other interesting
7:11
fights about the use of specific design
7:13
parents
7:14
firstly many ideas from the original
7:17
Super Mario Brothers seldom apparently
7:19
our games with parents such as the roof
7:21
Valley available gap and the gaps there
7:23
Valley really used secondly a lot of
7:27
design patterns are nobody's reskinned
7:30
to make them look fresh and appealing
7:32
although it's fundamentally the same
7:33
idea this actually meet some of the
7:35
research quite challenging particularly
7:37
when the analysis started on the new
7:39
super mario brothers games perhaps most
7:42
interesting new patterns are always and
7:46
I mean always inspired from existing
7:49
ones new design patterns appear in the
7:51
Mario series and abundance with 25 new
7:55
patterns recognizing the early phases of
7:57
this research however was really
7:59
fascinating is the each new pattern is
8:01
an innovation on an existing one
8:04
take for example a to path pattern shown
8:07
early on in the original Super Mario
8:08
Brothers that allows the player to pass
8:10
to clear a particular segment of the
8:12
game when evolution of this pattern is
8:14
to pass item with the well-known example
8:16
and world 1-1 of Super Mario Brothers 3
8:19
for the super early fellows Mario to fly
8:21
to a separate paths in the map the same
8:23
pattern is also inverted in the links of
8:26
Superman you land but the player must
8:28
not be carrying a
8:29
item to take a particular path some more
8:32
modern twists found in the New Super
8:33
Mario Brothers games include two paths
8:35
hidden where the path will be made
8:37
visible if Mario walks into as well as
8:39
two paths dead end which forces an
8:42
uncharacteristic behavior of having the
8:43
player bike track all 25 patterns
8:46
observed in subsequent games share some
8:48
fundamental relationship with an
8:50
original pattern from Super Mario
8:52
Brothers this tells us two things one
8:55
that the original analysis of Super
8:56
Mario Brothers sound but more
8:58
importantly there's a fundamental
9:00
language to Mario level design that
9:02
Nintendo must actually use whether this
9:05
is explicit or not or whether it's
9:07
invite annotated the same way that we
9:08
describe them we don't know but it's
9:11
clear that there is a core logic behind
9:13
each game enemies
9:15
despite this there are also some weird
9:18
habits with games like Super Mario Land
9:20
2 super mario world being the main
9:22
culprits for creating what we call
9:24
throwaways patterns the same parents
9:27
such as the spate trap and trench valley
9:29
that seldom appear ever and other Mario
9:33
games arguably the most exciting fame
9:37
from this analysis is the continued use
9:39
of the silent tutorial level 11 of Super
9:42
Mario Brothers creates an invaluable
9:44
tutorial on core gameplay mechanics and
9:46
its opening segment with Mario being
9:48
faced with a goomba as well as a
9:50
particular brick placement and ahead
9:51
mushroom in one of the question blogs
9:54
this is actually three design patterns
9:56
of once multiple paths establishing the
10:00
Mario can either run under the brake
10:02
blocks of jump onto them in this case
10:04
this is a two paths pattern single enemy
10:07
providing one enemy that will challenge
10:09
Mario risk/reward the culmination of the
10:12
head mushroom being in the same level as
10:14
the Goomba these three parents tell us
10:17
some really useful information on how to
10:18
play mario implicitly one you can use
10:22
the jump to either e kill an enemy or be
10:25
jump onto a platform to avoid being
10:26
attacked and in fact see it blocks to
10:30
fame datums number two touching a goomba
10:33
and not jumping on it or killers but
10:36
touching a mushroom reward errs three
10:39
sometimes it's really worth going for
10:40
the question blocks even if enemies are
10:42
nearby
10:43
this is a silent tutorial no text is
10:46
displayed your words are said but the
10:48
player gains tremendous insight on how
10:50
to play super mario brothers so it's
10:53
perhaps fitting then that the same
10:55
tutorial appears in the first level of
10:57
subsequent games with almost every game
11:00
using the same three patterns as we see
11:04
here in World 11 of Super Mario Brothers
11:06
3 the two path has changed to a three
11:08
paths with the mushroom on the top layer
11:11
meanwhile super mario world mixes up
11:14
with a coupe attacking from the top path
11:16
but the risk-reward this time being a
11:18
dragon coin a trimmed-down Russian of
11:22
the same pattern appears in Super Mario
11:23
Land fast-forward over a decade later
11:26
and new super mario brothers on the d/s
11:29
uses the same old trick we round up here
11:32
and New Super Mario Brothers you
11:34
repeating the same approach almost 30
11:37
years later it might change slightly but
11:41
at the end of the day it's always the
11:43
same patterns two or more paths and a
11:46
risk/reward gamble brought about by a
11:48
solitary enemy only super mario line two
11:51
fields to adhere to this pattern
11:54
what's fascinating is that the silent
11:56
tutorial has been setting and right
11:57
front of us all this time for 30 years
12:02
the new Superman of our series is
12:03
equally fascinating and that both
12:05
respect the traditions of older mario
12:07
games but continuous subverts four
12:09
screws around with them for his own
12:10
purposes while many old school parents
12:13
return new patterns emerge either to
12:15
expressly challenge old ideas such as
12:17
the two paths hidden or two paths dead
12:19
end for all patterns are matched
12:21
together and interesting ways this can
12:24
be summed up as pattern crossover
12:26
whereby two patterns are much together
12:28
to create something that isn't some
12:30
sense new
12:31
the example should know from New Super
12:33
Mario Bros u T two patterns and merge
12:36
them together to create something that
12:37
is not only a new experience but is
12:39
immediately relatable to anyone who has
12:41
knowledge of money or platforms in
12:43
general in each case one of the patterns
12:46
becomes the dominant where we have a
12:48
strong understanding of how to clear
12:49
this particular set of patterns given we
12:52
already have a lot of experience in
12:54
beating the dominant one
12:55
however the other one that's been merged
12:57
into it now provides some interesting
12:59
segment to kind of enhance the gameplay
13:01
in addition we observe cases of patterns
13:04
subversion for all parents return VAR
13:07
deliberately changed operate on lately
13:09
but expect a simple example appears in
13:11
New Super Mario Bros 2 where we see a 3
13:14
horde typically shown in other games as
13:16
good as attacking you one after the
13:18
other to know being stacked atop one
13:20
another we start to think about the same
13:23
core issue but I means of tackling it
13:25
changes to accommodate for the new
13:27
approach this leaves us with plenty of
13:29
questions for future manual level
13:31
analysis as the sand tutorial the only
13:34
one that exists
13:35
probably not we've already observed
13:37
parents and level types such as
13:40
underground high ground landed cetera
13:42
but whether specific patterns are used
13:44
with a certain frequency particular
13:45
point in time would be interesting to
13:47
discover there's a significant body of
13:50
the remaining it could be conducted once
13:52
this data has been annotated from across
13:54
walmart do games in addition taken much
13:57
this knowledge of pouring it into the
13:58
challenge of procedurally-generated
13:59
Mario levels would prove rather exciting
14:02
can we proceed to regenerate Mario
14:04
levels are a reflection of specific
14:06
games in the series can refrain means to
14:08
consolidate the creative spaces of these
14:10
systems to reflect specific mario games
14:13
and effectively create a I systems that
14:15
could build spiritual successors if you
14:17
will to establish games there's plenty
14:21
of work happening and procedural
14:22
generation of Maddie levels has already
14:24
been discussed in the Mario a
14:25
competition video but it's a topic of
14:28
continued relevance today as we wrap up
14:30
I want to take a moment to acknowledge
14:32
that all of the talking points from this
14:33
video are derived from actual academic
14:35
research in Super Mario level design
14:37
check out the video description for link
14:39
to numerous research papers by a variety
14:41
of academics on this topic from all over
14:43
the world
14:44
this video is also inspired by paper I
14:46
presented myself at the 2015 foundation
14:49
of digital games conference if you find
14:51
this research interesting take a moment
14:53
to read through these publications as
14:55
the cover these topics in far greater
14:56
detail and with that we close this video
14:59
wishing super mario brothers are very
15:02
happy 30th birthday and we look forward
15:04
to what's coming in the future thanks
15:07
for watching folks will see you soon
15:10
again
