this is ein games and welcome to a new
0:12
lecture entitled teaching robots to play
0:15
why science loves gaming quick heads up
0:18
with the original article as well as the
0:20
video as part of this is a reproduction
0:22
of a talk originally given during the
0:24
red sessions of the egx 2015 event at
0:27
the NEC in birmingham UK in September
0:30
2015 one of the most interesting aspects
0:35
of human behavior and by extension
0:36
applications of intelligence as a
0:39
species is the relationship that we
0:41
humans have with games in principle
0:43
games are tasks are challenges designed
0:45
to stimulate the brain however well our
0:47
brains are often forced to deal with
0:49
demanding and often stressful mentor
0:50
tasks as part of our daily lives we
0:53
still have time for games and the
0:54
notions of play games are designed to
0:56
keep his challenged but ultimately did
0:58
not prove so taxing that they proved too
1:00
demanding or stressful for our regular
1:03
consumption it's certainly interesting
1:04
to observe the relationship between
1:06
humans and the notion of play as a means
1:09
of relaxation their number of reasons
1:11
why games prove to be an interesting to
1:13
mean to explore scientific problems and
1:15
more importantly I challenges
1:17
perhaps unsurprisingly these are likely
1:20
reasons that humans already embrace them
1:21
one major reason that good games proved
1:26
so effective is that they act as
1:27
frameworks for reward through structured
1:29
activity games define looks of behavior
1:32
that have completed repeated
1:33
successfully will reward the player
1:35
through a number of means some of these
1:37
rewards are my other nature and maybe
1:39
purely cosmetic whereas others allow for
1:41
a sense of progression to be
1:43
conceptualized with the player these
1:45
interactions continue to increase in
1:46
scale to help maintain our players
1:48
interests and momentum until the
1:50
long-term an explicit reward is achieved
1:52
the Super Mario Brothers series is one
1:55
of the finest examples of her aboard
1:56
frameworks can be used to drive and
1:58
maintain player interests reward
2:00
interactions in the lips of behavior
2:02
required to release them are often
2:03
referred to as compulsion loops whereby
2:06
remaining players interest by shooting a
2:08
reward with an abstract and relative
2:10
time frame short-term loan
2:12
so often the result of simple
2:13
interactions that maybe like the
2:15
cosmetic but help maintain the players
2:17
engagement the interaction response from
2:19
the collection of coins and Superman
2:21
brothers may seem simple but the use of
2:23
counters and sound effects provide
2:25
positive reinforcement to users that
2:26
their actions not only makes sense but
2:29
also work towards their long-term goals
2:31
then subsequently skills to medium-term
2:33
compulsion loops conceptualize through
2:35
levels given every level of Super Mario
2:37
games celebrate the fact the player has
2:40
completed that activity returning back
2:42
to coin collection continued adoption of
2:45
the short-term look reward you with
2:47
extra lives this medium term loop is no
2:49
reinforcing a player's continued
2:51
adoption of the short-term loop and
2:52
gives not only context but a real
2:55
quantifiable reason to continue doing it
2:57
the skills father into long-term losses
3:00
activity as levels are grouped into
3:01
Worlds with the requirement to defeat a
3:03
boss enemy with closure achieve through
3:05
the field bozer and the eighth and final
3:07
world ultimately the point here is that
3:11
we have this confine system within which
3:12
intelligent decisions can be made we can
3:15
quantify their value as well as identify
3:17
their position within the roadmap of
3:18
future actions you can take in order to
3:20
win their game
3:21
conversely good games are able to
3:24
quickly point out bad and drank ginger
3:25
making and that's reinforced you that
3:27
doing certain things is bad
3:30
well Mario does a good job of this it's
3:31
arguably has compared to sonic hedgehog
3:33
who signifies this even better with
3:35
significantly exaggerated behavior and
3:37
the event rings are lost
3:39
that's losing our progress on that
3:40
medium-term loop but also when losing
3:42
lives the next major factor that helps
3:46
build a game as a valid scientific
3:47
problem is that it has to be fun
3:50
well finalize the subjective notion is
3:53
evidence to suggest that the level of
3:54
challenge involved must me a certain
3:56
threshold and are referred to be
3:58
interesting in the eyes of humans when
4:00
we consider this from a computer science
4:02
perspective we would actually classify
4:04
the games must be at least
4:05
non-deterministic polynomial time hard
4:08
or NP hyphen hard for short ensure this
4:11
means it's something of a non-trivial
4:13
problem in computer science
4:15
NP problems are typically ones that
4:17
require some intelligent algorithmic
4:19
process in order for them to be solved
4:21
in a reasonable amount of time if you
4:24
were to look at the range of games out
4:25
there
4:25
from online FPS games such as call of
4:28
duty to racing games like Forza and even
4:30
smaller and functionally similar games
4:32
such as flappy bird we can begin to
4:34
recognize a large range of problems that
4:36
are not only sufficiently difficult
4:38
video games but can rearrange of equally
4:40
interesting decision problems in their
4:42
own right
4:43
despite this assertion of a certain
4:44
level of computational define difficulty
4:46
we would not paint all games the same
4:48
games can carry a variety of problem
4:51
trees that make them interesting for
4:52
autonomous systems that try and solve
4:54
these trees can change between genres of
4:56
games and even releases within the same
4:58
game series these traits normally result
5:01
in games exhibiting particular
5:02
artificial intelligence problems but
5:04
also begin to necessitate the use of
5:06
certain AI techniques and methodologies
5:08
given their useful for that particular
5:09
type of problem country to the popular
5:12
opinion he is not some black box design
5:15
that will work in any and all
5:16
circumstances AI systems and the
5:19
techniques used to build them are
5:20
typically specialist in nature focusing
5:22
on very particular types of problems
5:24
only know after over 50 years of
5:27
research in this area are we seriously
5:28
looking at the challenges of building
5:30
general intelligence systems which we'll
5:33
discuss later there are several
5:35
properties of a game that we will
5:36
typically consider when trying to figure
5:37
out how best to approach the problem
5:39
there are three the proved to be rather
5:41
important number one accessible
5:44
knowledge just how much to be knew about
5:46
the game we're playing any point in time
5:48
this can be both a blessing and a curse
5:50
depending on how much we actually know
5:52
in some games we may not actually know
5:55
everything about the current state of
5:57
the game at this point in time step with
5:59
the case in card games ranging from
6:01
texas holdem to hearthstone we don't
6:03
know what cards the other player is
6:05
holding but can make some educated
6:07
guesses ultimately gate our
6:09
decision-making conversely we exploit
6:12
this imperfect information given up the
6:14
opponent does not know war hands we
6:16
might play but this doesn't mean that
6:18
knowing everything about the world will
6:20
help us that much either one of the best
6:22
examples of this can be found in
6:23
fighting games such as streetfighter
6:25
mortal kombat and killer instinct in
6:28
each case we can see the whole state of
6:30
the world where the players how much
6:32
health or energy bar they have and the
6:33
team remaining in that round
6:35
despite this the number of possible
6:38
actions that can be executed in that
6:39
state leads to a large number of
6:41
possible future states also known as
6:43
successors this large number of actions
6:47
and future state implies the branching
6:49
factor of a given state meaning that
6:51
even if we start thinking three or four
6:52
moves ahead we need to start filtering
6:54
out decisions that we don't think the
6:56
opposing player will make given the
6:57
number of possibilities is massive
7:00
number to predicting the unpredictable
7:04
one vital aspect of gaming's been able
7:07
to see things before they actually
7:08
happen allowing us to make quick
7:10
decisions and react to changes in the
7:12
world when playing platforming games we
7:14
quickly learned the minutiae of the
7:16
movement mechanics meaning we can
7:17
predict whether we can make certain
7:19
jumps in particular circumstances and
7:21
quickly adapt to survive predictability
7:23
can also come in really handy for
7:25
dealing with enemies learning the
7:27
behavior parents of bosses and games
7:29
such as dark souls is key to knowing
7:31
when to attack and went to fall back and
7:33
defend but sometimes our model of that
7:35
predictability is broken and that makes
7:37
things so much harder for us one of the
7:39
best examples of this can be found in
7:41
pac-man where the original ghosts are
7:43
deterministic in nature meaning we can
7:45
learn in time one enemy will do at any
7:47
point however in the sequel miss pac-man
7:49
that ghosts are able to make run moves
7:51
at junctions if this or wish this
7:53
results in a non deterministic system
7:55
meaning that we can no longer predict
7:57
safely making the game significantly
8:00
more difficult number three the players
8:04
the enemies and the actors just how many
8:07
characters are in this game and making
8:08
Sammy intelligent decisions this ties
8:11
back to normal the complexity issue but
8:13
also the branching factor discussed
8:15
earlier the branching factors influence
8:17
not just on how many actions you can
8:19
make it any given state or frame of that
8:21
game but also the actions that any other
8:23
character can make in that world the
8:25
number of unique configurations of the
8:27
game world can explode an exponential
8:29
rate once you have multiple characters
8:31
that can all do different things at once
8:33
we need to figure out a which
8:35
information is useful to us be what we
8:37
can ignore and see how do we ensure that
8:40
the space of all potential game
8:41
configurations is tractable meaning that
8:44
any i can actually search it to find
8:46
answers
8:47
despite all this for boarding and gloom
8:49
the stone awful lot to celebrate my
8:51
research and games kept off in full
8:53
swing in the mid-2000s with a number of
8:55
big projects bringing the community
8:56
together as well as solving some
8:58
interesting challenges the second major
9:01
problem area together attention was a
9:03
the complete Mario which actually turned
9:05
out to be a lot easier than we
9:07
originally envisaged and fight the more
9:09
interesting problems were not whether i
9:10
could play mario but whether it could
9:12
build manual levels leading to a sudden
9:15
surge in research and procedural content
9:17
generation be sure to check out the
9:19
rather large overview of the game
9:21
playing level generation tracks we have
9:22
your AI in games something of an
9:25
interesting challenge to create a I the
9:27
complete unreal tournament 2004
9:30
however unlike most challenges this was
9:32
not about trying to beat the game or be
9:34
the most effective at it but whether you
9:36
could fill other humans into believing
9:37
that the ball was not an AI this is an
9:40
example of the cheering test in which
9:42
you build the either contact or tasks we
9:44
would expect of a human but design it
9:45
such that it cannot be distinguished
9:47
from humans when observed this
9:49
competition run for several years until
9:51
the winner was found that was able to
9:52
fool judges into believing it was
9:54
actually a human player
9:56
despite this the still lot of work to do
9:59
and many challenges yet to be solved we
10:02
break down some of the bigger talking
10:03
points here as was pointed out to some
10:05
interesting reading material for you to
10:06
check out if you're interested
10:09
PCG has become a big talking point in
10:11
the academic community for a number of
10:13
reasons it's perhaps not considered a is
10:15
such in the wider discussion
10:16
regenerative systems are making
10:18
intelligent decisions to craft artifacts
10:20
what makes this an even bigger task is
10:23
that how to evaluate this content is
10:24
highly subjective unlike many other AI
10:27
problems such as robotics shelling and
10:29
even playing games we cannot holding
10:31
evaluate the quality of the final hope
10:33
and a robotics problem we can evaluate
10:36
against the expected behavior or even
10:38
how well the robot works and specific
10:40
circumstances however with generated
10:42
content but we can evaluate whether it
10:45
adheres to specific functional aspect we
10:47
make struggle to identify more aesthetic
10:49
and subjective aspect of that content so
10:52
while we can quantify whether a gun can
10:54
actually hurt an enemy or other levels
10:56
playable it's much harder to establish
10:58
whether that gun was interesting too
11:00
use or of that level was fun to play
11:02
some links to check out include Angelina
11:05
which is the AI system built to create
11:07
entire games by itself the Alpha
11:09
mentioned Mario a competition piece here
11:12
nain games.com as well as checking out
11:14
prop Joe a game jam all about procedural
11:16
content generation one of the most
11:20
exciting fields happening any I right
11:22
now is the notion of general
11:23
intelligence the reason for this is an
11:25
actuality I systems are typically
11:27
specialist in nature in other words
11:29
they're very good at one thing and one
11:30
thing alone
11:31
this is country to love science fiction
11:33
and that for example Skynet and the
11:35
Terminator our showdown in the system
11:37
shock
11:37
our systems are largely omnipotent and
11:39
can solve any problem placed in front of
11:41
them
11:41
this can be seen when developing a I the
11:43
complete a particular game but we can
11:46
write any I the complete pacman it
11:47
cannot play super mario brothers and
11:49
vice versa
11:50
this is an issue that spreads far beyond
11:52
games into larger real-world problems
11:54
general intelligence is the challenge of
11:57
building AI that can solve any problem
11:58
you give it which is far more in line
12:01
with the original aspirations of AI from
12:02
the early 20th century
12:04
this is now a big problem with research
12:06
departments at universities as well as
12:07
big tech companies attempting to solve
12:09
it
12:10
some links to check out and put the
12:12
three-part series the challenge of
12:13
general intelligence and games was
12:15
denying games as well as looking at the
12:17
general video game AI competition hosted
12:19
at the university of essex in the UK as
12:21
well as Google deep mains work and
12:23
exactly the same problem area to
12:26
conclude as games become more
12:27
increasingly complex so do the
12:29
artificial intelligence systems that
12:31
seek to learn from them we are fortunate
12:33
in the gaming is such a vibrant creative
12:34
field given it provides a continuous
12:36
body of complex and interesting problem
12:38
spaces to be working within in our own
12:40
way signs loves gaming for our own
12:42
selfish reasons with complex problem
12:44
spaces that require reactive and
12:46
long-term decision-making systems to
12:48
handle some of the most dynamic and
12:49
multifaceted domains ok to the real
12:51
world itself there to be honest sciences
12:55
into games were pretty much the same
12:56
reasons as everyone else
12:58
we're here to have fun this has been
13:00
teaching robots to play by science labs
